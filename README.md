# Dragons- 

## Introduction 

I have created an app which allows you to pick a dragon you like and give the picture a number of likes and submit it for that dragon. You can hover over a dragon to magnify it slightly to confirm, that dragon is what you intend to click on. 

## Steps 

Step 1: Start your server by running `json-server --watch db.json`

Step 2: Go to http://localhost:3000/dragons in your browser

Step 3: Click on any dragon of your liking and add desired likes 

Step 4: Submit your likes
